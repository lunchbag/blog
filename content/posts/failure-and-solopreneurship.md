This is a really hard post to write. I've been meaning to write this for weeks now, and I've been pushing it off until now. Ultimately, I realized my hesitation comes from the discomfort of being so vulnerable and open.

But I feel like this is what I've been preaching since the genesis of this blog. Transparency leads to demystifying perceived challenges and hardships and I've always been passionate about that, from writing about [my travels](https://lunchbag.ca/checking-in-things-i-ve-learned/) or [mistakes as an entrepreneur](https://lunchbag.ca/lunch-money-mistakes/). Showing that the journey is not a linearly paved road and that you define your own success despite failures seems to have been inspirational to a number of my readers. Being honest about the challenges I've faced has never been short of rewarding.

So this time should be no different, right?

Except it is very different. You see, the failure I'm about to share has nothing to do with my business or solopreneurship, and it isn't related to stories of temporary travel.

It has to do with my personal life.

And one thing I've realized is how intertwined my work and life are. In many ways, this seems like a bad thing. If you don't have a work/life balance, the assumption is you never know when to stop working and you don't take time to enjoy life.

But there's actually a different interpretation with solopreneurship. At least for me, solopreneurship works because I want "work" to be a part of my life. It's one of my hobbies. It's something I do because I genuinely enjoy it and I derive a lot of personal satisfaction from it.

So, when my personal life changed suddenly overnight, it brought everything down with it, including my work in solopreneurship, my online presence, and overall, my _joie de vivre._ But, I assure you that my recent absence is not out of neglect for the product. 

## **My personal failure**

The failure I'm alluding is the failure of my marriage. Almost overnight in September, I went from being what I thought was happily and securely married to starting divorce arrangements. 

Heartbreak, betrayal, worthlessness, confusion. Just a small roster of feelings accompanying the roller coaster I haven't been able to get off for the last few months. It was only recently I started to consistently find reason to get out of bed every morning.

I am in so much flux in my life right now. It's like I've been thrown off my trajectory and I'm now rocketing through space. I don't know what debris I'll hit along the way or which orbit I'll eventually land in. The experiences I've been going through in the last few months are superlativeâ€“ it's been the most trying time of my life, the loneliest I've ever felt, the most purposeless, among just a few. The uncertainty is terrifying on many levels. However, it's not all bad. In seeking comfort and support from my friends as well as hearing from strangers on the internet and Lunch Money users who noticed my absence, honestly, it's also the most loved I've ever felt.

## **So, what's next?**

One of the hardest parts about divorce is that 100% of future plans you made or envisioned for yourself and your (future) family all goes out the window. Suddenly, my life is an empty and open field. Exciting, sure, maybe eventually when I'm in a different headspace. Terrifying, definitely. It's got me asking fundamental questions, like, what do I want out of my time on this Earth? What should my purpose be? What parts of my previous life served me well and do I want to carry forward into my new life? _What the hell do I do with my life now?!_

Most people have an anchor. A job that keeps them in a certain place. Family that keeps them within a certain radius. Pets with certain environmental needs.

Well, I am totally unanchored. It's both exciting and scary at the same time. I could literally do anything! I could move to Iceland, buy a van, and live in it for a year if I wanted to. But, well, despite living as a "digital nomad" for the last few years, I don't want to do that anymore.

### **I moved to Los Angeles.**

I haven't lived somewhere for more than 1.5 years in the last 6 years. Right now, I'm craving permanence and control. Permanence to me means living somewhere and settling down and building a new life there. Control means I solely get to decide where and when. Moving to Los Angeles was honestly the easiest decision to make. I knew right away I wanted to start my new life there, where I have a solid support group of friends, year-round nice weather, and a bevy of foods to try.

### **I am building a team around Lunch Money.**

I've been feeling at a crossroads for the last few weeks. My whole motivation for Lunch Money previously was to build a stream of passive income that I'd still work on as a hobby while pursuing other things in my personal life, like buying a house, settling down, having kids, etc. It was part of a grand plan to retire early and enjoy family life. Obviously, that's out the window now.

The truth of the matter is that my personal motivation, while still there, has changed from the days of being excited to work on it 24/7. I have the financial resources and renewed passion to pursue other endeavors and I have a reinvigorated sense of purpose beyond Lunch Money. 

Lunch Money has positively affected thousands of users so far and I have no intention of turning my back on them. In fact, it makes me more motivated than ever to continue pushing Lunch Money to its fullest potential. Therefore, I am going to be building out a team around Lunch Money. The first few hires will be engineers. I'm committed to finding a group of technical folks that work well together, believe in the product and genuinely want to see it grow.

So don't worry, Lunch Money is here to stay. But what else is next for me?

### **I am starting a new company!**

I've come to truly realize the immense value that Lunch Money has had on my life. It doesn't make a million dollars a year, but it makes enough for me to have been able to take off the last 3 months. It taught me grit, perseverance, and initiative. It showed me what I was able to achieve on my own, and the impact that I, as a singular person, can have on a community of other builders, entrepreneurs and people interested in tracking their personal finance. It was incredible for my self-confidence, for my personal purpose and for my outlook on life.

Though rewarding, it was also one of the hardest things I've ever done, especially because it was inexplicably important to me to work on Lunch Money all on my own. Perhaps I needed to see what I could achieve on my own, but maybe I also was afraid to ask for help. I hit many roadblocks but was always able to either move past them and share my learnings along the way.

My new mission is to help other people build their own lifestyle businesses.

_More than anything, it afforded me the luxury of freedom and independence. Without the burden of a 9-5 job, I was able to take weeks off at a time, for better or for worse. I was able to feel all my feelings, get through a depressive state without feeling guilty. Waking up and deciding not to do anything at all for weeks at a time was not ideal, but honestly necessary for my healing. And doing so without the burden of anyone or anything depending on me was the type of control and autonomy I needed to get through things._

Through my healing, I realized there were undeniable parallels between my personal life and professional life. For one, it was inexplicably important to me to work on Lunch Money all on my own. Perhaps I needed to see what I could achieve on my own, but maybe I also was afraid to ask for help. Much like in my personal life, I realized I never opened up to my friends about any troubles or issues I was going through until it all came crashing down. However, once I started doing it, I immediately reaped the benefits and rewards. I felt heard, seen, validated. I felt the support of my friends, and I truly believe I was able to heal much faster. It paid off to be vulnerable, ask for help and to lean on others and none of that made me any less of the independent person I know myself to be.

**Introducing: Picnic Collective, Inc**

Lunch Money's parent company is called Lunchbag Labs, which is very me-centric. My moniker online is "lunchbag" and everything I've done under that company has been very individualistic. I've freelanced and built apps all under my own name. It's been great, but admittedly lonely and always self-serving.

What I realized is that while we all think we can do everything on our own, we can go a lot further as a community. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness. Hiring contractors or having a mentor doesn't strip you of your abilities of an individual or your title of solopreneur.

It feels like for the last decade, I've been eating lunch by myself. So, what happens when everyone brings their own "lunchbag" to the party? This is the idea behind **Picnic Collective, Inc**.

Over the course of working on Lunch Money, I've had the pleasure of meeting lots of other bootstrapped founders, aspiring solopreneurs and curious working engineers. Blogging about my hardships and successes always opened up the conversation with other folks and the similar challenges they're going through. Writing about my successes with hiring a contract marketing manager prompted a handful of people to ask if they can outright hire the same person. I realized that sometimes we don't realize what we need until we see it work for someone else, and even then, the sourcing and vetting process in and of itself is very daunting.

Traditionally in Silicon Valley, we are fed this idea that it's hard to do it all on your own. Either you'll be strapped for resources (financially or human) and the allure of IPOs and exits reveals an obvious goal of needing to raise money or find investors. Accelerators sell you the idea of a network of resources in exchange for equity, after which they've got their foot in the door to tell you how to run your own company. I've been through all this before and it's precisely at that point where you start to lose your freedom and autonomy.

_And then there are mini accelerators that are geared towards bootstrapped founders, but the goals are not aligned. They still take equity and push you towards meeting investors. Their main metric is how many of their companies raised money after completing a one-size-fits-all curriculum._

Of course, for many folks, this works for them. The ambitious CEO who loves to network and scale and can see themselves running a company of hundreds, if not thousands. But what about for the rest of us who would prefer to keep things small, who would prefer to run a small mom-and-pop shop. It just seems daunting to go about it all alone.

But here's the thing. Everyone has a different story, motivation, and dreams. Going the venture capital route is not for everyone. Getting funding to help you quit your day job is paradoxical. Picnic Collective is meant to fill the needs in those gaps. 

We are a collective of bootstrapped founders, established solopreneurs, trusted industry experts and overall passionate folks who are interested in pursuing lifestyle businesses without the headache of giving up equity for resources or the commitment of hiring full-time. We are the "phone a friend" when you need it. We are what makes the journey less lonely. Your goals, dreams and aspirations take the front seat and we are merely a support system when you need it. You and your business are the priority, not investors. We care about growth and independence. We want to encourage the online equivalent of "buy local" and mom and pop shops. This is our shared ethos.

We find value in the stories behind the business, highlighting the founder journey. 

A totally custom and tailored to you program of offerings.
