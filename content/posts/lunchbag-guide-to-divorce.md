Why am I writing this

* inspire
* you're not alone
* no one should go thorugh the hard parts alone
* a lot of the hard things in life don't have a step by step guide or blueprint

celebrate being by your fucking self

societal expectations

not your decision

it's not what happens to you, it's how you react to it

Stayed with friends, 2x, realizations

Birthday solo road trip

Living alone again

Divorce party

Solo honeymoon

main thing that helped:

* friends and opening up to them (solopreneurs are hard to do this)
* the way that i was raised was always to keep problems to yourself because they're shameful
* constnatly not putting myself first because i was worried about what he must have been going thorugh to do what he did

re-reading the new beginnings post, i feel my pain but its a pain i know i havent felt in al ong time
