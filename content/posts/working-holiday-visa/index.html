      <a href="http://www.youth.gc.ca/eng/topics/jobs/abroad.shtml">Working Holiday Visas</a> (or Youth Mobility Agreements) are a little-known benefit of being a Canadian citizen. The idea is that you can live in a country for about a year with the option of working to pay your way through your travels. Canada has formal agreements with many countries to allow youth to work there temporarily.</span><p><span>Here are the basics (varies by country and exceptions do occur as listed under "Jen's Notes"):</span><li>You'll need to hold a passport, valid for at least 3 to 6 months past your working holiday term;</li><li>You'll need to prove that you can support yourself minimally by showing a bank statement (amount required shown below);</li><li>You'll need to meet an age range, between 18 to 30 or 35 (shown below);</li><li>Visas are typically non-renewable and only valid for 1 year;</li><li>You'll need to apply for this visa while you're in Canada;</li><li>There are generally no restrictions on the type of work that you do;</li><li>Most of these Working Holiday Visas are multiple entry;</li><li>No dependents (kids or spouses) are allowed to come with you on this visa;</li><li>Most WHV require an application fee (shown below); and</li><li>Most WHV won't require you to have prior arrangements (shown below)– as in a work or internship contract or housing.</li></p><p>The details is scattered across all the different embassy websites. These are pretty difficult to navigate sometimes and not all the information is there. I've consolidated as much of the information as I could find into this centralized source. I hope this helps you out and encourages you to take advantage of this awesome opportunity!</p><p><i>Last updated: December 8, 2016</i></p><p><i>Information presented here may not be accurate or is subject to change at any time so please only use this as the starting ground and conduct your own due dilligence.</i></p><!-- MAPBOX--><a name="map"></a><div id="whv-map" class="map"></div><!-- TABLE OF INFORMATION--><!-- AUSTRALIA--><a name="Australia"></a><table class="whv-main"><tr><td class="whv-main-td whv-country-overview"><span class="whv-country-name">Australia</span></td><td class="whv-main-td whv-fast-facts"><table id="whv-inner"><tr><td><span class="whv-header">Maximum Stay</span>12 months, renewable</td><td><span class="whv-header">Application Cost</span>CA$450</td></tr><tr><td><span class="whv-header">Age Range</span>18 - 30</td><td><span class="whv-header">Savings Required</span>CA$5200</td></tr><tr><td><span style="padding-top: 15px;" class="whv-header">Prior Arrangements</span>Not required</td><td><span style="padding-top: 15px;" class="whv-header">More Information</span><a href="http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1/417-" target="_blank">Link</a></td></tr></table></td><td class="whv-main-td whv-notes"><span class="whv-header">From the embassy website</span>This visa is for young people who want to holiday and work in Australia for up to a year.
