+++

I'm changing the pricing structure for Lunch Money. And contrary to what you might be thinking, we're not raising our prices– **we're actually lowering them**, giving our users even more control over their finances.

## The Notable Changes

We’re keeping it simple with a $10 monthly plan and a pay-what-you-want model for annual plans, ranging from $40 to $150. Depending on what you choose, you may unlock some perks! The plans are still offered in CAD, USD and EUR.
All old plans are now considered legacy. Unless you change your plan, we will continue to honor your original pricing plan.
All coupon codes are discontinued.
We\* now offer the ability to pause your subscription and get credit for unused time. You’ll be able to use that towards future subscriptions again at any time. Your data will not be deleted in this case.

## Why the changes?

Lunch Money is an internationally used app. We* are prioritizing accessibility to our app and deprioritizing maximizing profits. The latter is not fulfilling on its own. It doesn’t account for economic variability, big life changes, hard times, etc. We* want to give more control to our users. We\* want to be a people-first company.
From a technical standpoint, this helps keeps things wayyyy simpler. We have offered 7 (!!!) tiers of pricing since we first launched in 2019 with a variety of coupon codes. Billing is a massively important part of the business and it’s been more complicated than I’d like to continue doing things the old way.
I’ve been allowing folks to email in to request for discounts which has been eye-opening the amount of people Lunch Money can provide value to, but ultimately was out of reach because of pricing. I’ve also surveyed existing users and I’m seeing that many would be more willing to refer their friends & family if the price point was lower.

## Won’t you lose money?

Well, probably for the first few months after the changes, the revenue growth will dip a bit but we’re confident we will see a rise in new subscribers and referrals. Our community will only continue to grow and our mission to make personal finance delightfully simple and accessible will reach new heights.
Why offer the same amount in all three currencies? What about the variations in exchange rates?
Over the course of nearly 4 years of Lunch Money, our billing currency exchange rates (CAD, EUR and USD) have all fluctuated so much. It’s an extra headache to keep the values equal. This just makes it simpler.

Since launching in 2019, Lunch Money has become an internationally used app. With our users' support and our lean company structure, we were able to achieve profitability within the first few years of business.

Now, we have decided to prioritize accessibility to our app and deprioritize maximizing profits. The latter is not fulfilling on its own. It shuts people out who could really benefit from Lunch Money, and doesn’t account for regional economic variability, big life changes, hard times, etc.

We want to give back to all our users– past, present & future, who support our journey, helping us achieve something we never thought imaginable. We aim to truly be a people-first company and we love giving a whole new meaning to "gain control of your finances"!
