Hello world!

It’s been over a month since our last correspondence. Justin and I have been doing very well in Fukuoka. We settled in fairly quickly, having found a routine that works for us which includes grocery shopping at our local supermarket, going to the gym every morning and rotating through a trio of hot teas (soba tea, green tea, and rooibos!) throughout the day.

Our time has been split between working on our personal programming projects, continue our contracting work, keeping up our fitness regimen, learning Japanese, and anything food-related such as cooking at home and seeking out restaurants. These are precisely the goals we set out for ourselves before we left home. This leaves little time for much else, notably seeing all the tourist spots, local attractions and taking day trips to nearby cities. Although we do take the effort to take days off from our routine to explore, our goal in Fukuoka is not to vacation. We wanted to see if we are able to be just as, if not more, productive in a foreign environment while preserving our values (staying financial lean and physically healthy) and personal goals (fitness, cooking, etc), thereby proving that this lifestyle could be sustainable to repeat in the future– our ultimate goal.

That being said, our first month in Fukuoka has definitely been an adventure. We ate new and amazing food, learned a lot of surprising new things, struggled a ton, and had small language barrier wins.

## What's awesome

### Supermarkets

The supermarkets in Fukuoka will be sorely missed when we leave– the asian grocery store in Markham do not compare. Very affordable Japanese ingredients make it very easy to experiment with cooking new dishes that would normally cost me $20 just for the raw ingredients back home (I'm referring mainly to kelp, bonito flakes, and sake).

In my opinion, supermarket sushi here is comparable to lower mid-tier sushi restaurants back home in Toronto. The kicker though is that the value is amazing. On top of that, if you go after 7:30pm, most of the sushi and sashimi will be discounted and if you get lucky, you get a coveted second discount sticker!

Furthermore, the selection of yuzu products is unbelievable. For the uninitiated, yuzu is a very flavourful citrus fruit popular in Japan and Korea. Its peel and zest can enhance any dish, soup, cocktail, cake– you name it. Since arriving in Japan, we've discovered so many more applications of this fruit, most notably in sauces and condiments! Yuzu kosho (柚子胡椒) is a paste made from chili pepers and yuzu peels and is wonderfully addicting to add to any meats. Yuzu ponzu and yuzu ichimi (Japanese chili pepper seasoning) are also among our pantry. Not to mention, our favorite つけ麺 (tsukemen, dipping ramen noodle) uses yuzu in their soup! We'll definitely be bringing back yuzu products in our suitcases.

The other notable difference about the supermarkets here, or at least the Sunny’s (which are owned by Walmart) is that there is a special station past the checkout counter where you can take your time to pack your own groceries. It works like this: you bring your basket to the cashier. The cashier grabs another basket and places it on the other side of the food scanner. They then scan everything from your basket and then places it neatly into the other basket. Finally, you pay, and you take your re-packed basket to the packing counter where they provide you with thin clear plastic bags in case you have meat that you want to double-pack. I really like this system a lot because everything moves faster and it takes away that pressure of packing your groceries quickly.

## What's not so great

### Working remotely

This is without a doubt the biggest disappointment we have encountered in Fukuoka (and maybe Japan in general?). Justin and I both work remotely, so we only need a reliable internet connection and our laptops to get things done. In all the cities we have spent time in (San Francisco, Taipei, Toronto), coffee shop culture has been very welcoming to laptops. However, in Japan, coffee shop culture is very different. From what we can tell, using your laptop is frowned upon yet staying at a coffee shop for hours on your phone is okay!

Thankfully, we have discovered a whopping two places in the city of Fukuoka that are open to laptop workers. The first is called Startup Cafe and it has been a godsend– we probably go about 5 times a week. It is essentially a free co-working space open from 10AM to 10PM with very fast internet. The atmosphere is like a library and we believe it’s funded by the local government in an attempt to stir entrepreneurial interests among locals. They provide free tax, immigration, and law consulting services and put on lots of local events. The downside is that they will be renovating starting March 1st and there will be no free co-working space offered anymore!

The second alternative is a store called Tsutaya. Now, there are two kinds of Tsutayas, so you have to be careful. One of them is a time portal back to the 90’s and the other one is set in the future. The one from the past is a multi-story CD and DVD rental store that makes Blockbuster look like a pop up shop. The other one is a re-imagined bookstore concept that allows you to read books and shop for related items in the store. They have a large Starbucks with free wi-fi and outlets where you can stay for literally hours on your laptop.

### Smokers

In Japan, it is legal to smoke indoors at restaurants. It's terrible. There's no worse feeling than getting excited about the food you ordered and having another patron next to you start smoking a cigarette.

### Coffee selection

While (mostly) everything in Japan is cheaper than in the Western world, one thing that is not is the coffee here. A latte usually will run you at least ¥500 which is about US$4.50 and it usually comes in a tiny size. On top of that, decaffeinated coffee is extremely rare in Japan as is non-dairy milk options.

### The bus system

The way the bus works here is quite interesting. The pricing is variable which means the further you ride, the more expensive your fare will be.

You enter through the back door only where you tap your IC card. When you tap, you'll notice a number. That's the number that indicates your ride segment. At the front of the bus is a screen with a grid. Whatever the number is under your ride segment number is the price you'll pay. As the bus drives further, the numbers will go up accordingly!

### Raised rubber tiles

All main streets in Fukuoka have these yellow raised rubber tiles. They are for the visually impaired! When you get to an intersection, the rubber tiles fan out and are yellow circles instead.

### High school reputations

Apparently this is a thing in Taiwan as well because when we first stumbled upon this, our Taiwanese friend was surprised that we had never seen something like this before.

This, being a full-blown board of statistics of the graduating class of the high school it's placed in front of.

The middle (red) column is a list of all the companies that graduates who chose not to go to university will be working at. It's also denoted whether this company is a corporation, public service (i.e. police force), or a small company/start-up. On the right side lists various "certifications" and how many of the graduating students were able to get them. Apparently Microsoft Office must be a highly regarded skill in Japan.

It seems what high school you went to in Japan as well as how many years it took you to complete it bears a lot of weight for the rest of your life. A friend that we met in Japanese told us that even if you are 50 years old and applying for a job, you must put down the city you came from, your birthday, the high school you went to, and what year you graduated. From that, employers can calculate if you were able to complete high school in the standard 4 years or if you had to take an extra year to complete it. From this, they seem to be able to judge your character and employability. In Japan, your successes and failures seem to follow you throughout your entire career.
