title = "4 career decisions that helped prepare me for solopreneurship"

+++
Hello! ðŸ‘‹  My name is Jen and Iâ€™m the founder, engineer, designer and customer support at Lunch Money, a personal finance and budgeting web app.

I didn't start working on Lunch Money with the plan of becoming a full-fledged company of one. I definitely wasn't always well-equipped to be a solopreneur but I feel like certain decisions I've made from graduation until now have made the path easier for me. 

Reflecting on how I got to where I am doing, I realized there are 4 major life decisions I made that have had significant contribution to where I am today. Here's what I believe are four career or life decisions I made that led to me on my current trajectory of being a solo founder and company of one.

## **Pick a company that's going to fuel  growth**

Personally, I felt like Twitter was the right choice for me to start my career. When I joined, there were maybe 300 engineers and by the time I left, the company had 10x to about 3000. I was able to experience in fast motion the growth of a company and it was apparent how this growth permeated through the company and affected the engineering side of things.

If I had joined a company that was already huge, it would be harder for me to experience a lot of things first-hand. Seeing how relatively relaxed processes were in the beginning to needing to write detailed post-mortems and hold numerous sync meetings weekly was important to understand that there is a right time to change things.

Mentorship is also important. Joining a small startup with a bunch of new grads or engineers with only a few years of experience is different than joining a startup with seasoned engineers. On my last team at Twitter, I worked with a team of older engineers who were friends and moved to Twitter together via an acquisition. They were definitely the smartest engineers I may ever work with in my career and they undoubtedly accelerated my growth by holding me to high standards for code and testing.

Lastly, the most important factor is whether or not I am learning transferrable skills at this company. Take for example the two internships I had during my college years. The first was at Qualcommâ€“ a large well-known international company that surely could have been a cushy place to spend 30+ years and retire. The second was a small start-up of 3 founders, another intern and myself that was on a time crunch due to a shrinking runway.

To any parent from an older generation (and certainly mine), Qualcomm seems to be the obvious choice. Discounting the fact that Qualcomm is in a totally different field of embedded software and hardware engineering, a lot of the tech I worked with was proprietary. I learned virtually no transferrable hard skills during my two internships at Qualcomm.

At the smaller start-up, I learned how to use Github. I learned how to talk to clients as I was building mobile apps for them using a cross-platform development tool. I learned how to think about web versus mobile design. I learned a ton of Javascript. These are all things I am still utilizing today.

I've also heard stories of software engineers working at large software companies that simplify a lot of processes for the sake of moving fast. For instance, one-click deploy of a database with homegrown configuration files for adjustments. They'd later on realize as they were job hunting that spinning up a data store was not so straight forward, but all the difficult parts had been abstracted out and they never got the chance to peek under the hood.

So, when you're interviewing for your next gig, here are some questions I wouldn't hesitate to ask your potential future employer:

1. Who are the potential mentors on my team?
2. What open-source software, if any, do you use or contribute to?
3. What kind of post-mortem process do you have?
4. What hard skills might I learn from this role?

If you're aspiring to eventually run your own business, chances are you do not plan to stay at any one company for over 4 years. Therefore, you need to be strategic with the company you choose to join. Your time is valuable.

## **Switch teams to optimize for experience breadth-depth ratio**

I feel strongly that working on three different teams at Twitter helped me gain the most experience. I stayed on each team for roughly 3 years, having made significant impact on each before moving onto another team.

My first team was the Observability team which was responsible for building a Mixpanel for internal use. I was specifically hired to work on the front-end side of things so I had full autonomy over the UI and UX of these dashboards. I myself wasn't a hardcore user of this tool, so I talked a lot with other engineers and was able to hone my skills of listening to their issues or feature requests and figuring out what was feasible. I learned Ruby on Rails and backbone.js, my first two frameworks ever.

To be honest, I would have probably stayed on that team if it weren't for my manager and another team that was looking to "borrow" an engineer for some high priority growth initiatives. My manager volunteered me and I was excited to work on a public-facing project for once. Little did I know there was a breakdown in communication and the receiving team, hearing that I was coming from "Platform Engineering", assumed that I was a backend and Scala wiz.

I ended up learning Scala on the job. It certainly wasn't easy going from Javascript to a strongly-typed language but a few late nights and with the help of some very patient engineers, I was able to help ship a couple of high impact features including being the sole backend engineer supporting the World Cup new user experience efforts.

A few months later I decided it was time to switch teams again. I ended up going to an infrastructure-level team working on messaging (SMS, push notifications and email) efforts. I would continue writing Scala under the mentorship of some of the most seasoned engineers at Twitter at the time and I ended up rewriting the entire infrastructure that interpreted text messages from scratch.

All in all, during my time at Twitter I was able to work up and down the stack, from data visualization and front-end UI/UX work all the way down to writing scalable infrastructure. The amount of variance between each team was important too. I oscillated between writing code from scratch to working in existing code and following rigid practices. I worked on efforts by myself as well as under the watchful eye of staff engineers.

## **Build something from scratch**

In my early 20s, I got really into electronic dance music (EDM). I found myself going out dancing most Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. Since San Francisco was home to numerous clubs, it became a chore to discover events. Some events were on Facebook while others were on ticketing platforms like Eventbrite, Ticketfly, etc. For the most part, you had to go to each individual club's website and navigate their calendars to find what was coming up.

A friend who grew up in the bay area and was a veteran in the scene told me about a now-defunct site that used to aggregate all EDM events into a calendar and it was wildly popular. I thought this was a fantastic idea, well within my technical scope at the time and I got to work.

For the first time in a while, I stayed home during weekends instead of going out to hammer out an MVP in Ruby on Rails. The MVP was basically a one-pager with a list of manually-inserted events sorted by date. I started to tell my friends about the site and it proved invaluable. Eventually, word of mouth spread and my site peaked at 1000 WAU.

The site evolved over the next few months. I learned to incorporate the Gracenote API which would automatically label each event with the genre of EDM. The Eventbrite and Ticketfly APIs helped to automate some of the event insertions. I implemented a form submission where people could suggest events to add. I started a Facebook community (grew to 1000+) and learned about how to put out basic ads. I was also able to make a few bucks every month with affiliate marketing.

Unfortunately, the eventual fade of my interest in EDM took with it my site as a casualty.

The coolest part (which I've yet to re-experience with Lunch Money) was that I was at a show once and I met someone there. I asked them if they had heard of my site and they pulled up their phone to show me it was the last site they had visited. That blew my mind!

The point is, build something from scratch. It can be anything. This started as a one pager and it slowly grew with interest. While it didn't go anywhere significant, I learned a ton and worked out the muscle of "learning by doing". Your first few projects may not end up being the breakthrough ones but they are invaluable in experience. It will also help you get used to putting yourself out there and launching things.

## **Take a sabbatical**

It's important to take a sabbatical to strip away the biases that exist in your current environment. If you were to ask me when I was living in San Francisco why I would want to start a company, my honest answer would probably be something related to boosting my ego, gaining clout among my Silicon Valley peers, or making a ton of money so I could afford a little condo in the Mission.

I moved out of San Francisco for good and took significant time off before settling back down in Toronto in 2017. I sought after experiences I knew I would never come across otherwise. I ended up living in various abodes in Northeastern Thailand, among the poorest villages in the country. I also spent time in the French countryside where wages are low, and cost of living was manageable. It reminded me of the other joys in lifeâ€“ family, nature and community.

Being in a totally new environment helped me see almost right away that I wanted to end back up in Toronto, not San Francisco. Everything I wanted when I was back in San Francisco was in the framework of that environment. That I wanted to be closer, both physically and emotionally, to my parentsâ€“ a thought that rarely came up during the hustle of San Francisco. I realized I never wanted to work for someone else again and seeing as I had the best summer of my life with very little spending, that money wasn't as crucial to my happiness as I thought it would be.
