TL;DR: Lived in Japan for 5 months, spent most of that time developing an app from scratch that I've always wanted to make while also freelancing, learning Japanese and familiarizing with the culture and hosting visiting friends and family.

# Summary

Last August, Justin and I booked our round-trip tickets from Toronto to Asia to leave Jan 3 and coming back May 8th. We just knew we wanted to uproot ourselves and have an experience abroad and thought that we would figure the rest out naturally. We honestly had no idea what we would get into or do with our time while we were abroad. Some ideas that came to mind (and did not come to fruition) included getting into calligraphy, learning martial arts, joining some local sports group, and taking online courses in something new, like digital animation.

Being away from familial and other social obligations removes distractions and frees up our mental space. Leaving for such a long time also forces you to wrap up everything you have going on in your current place. When you arrive to your new home you end up with a free slate and distraction-free environment to focus on whatever you want.

So that "whatever you want" for me ended up being an app that I have been wanting to develop for almost a year now.

This is the story about my journey of creating this app from scratch and how it fit in with other commitments such as freelancing, living/traveling abroad, and hosting friends and family.

## The Inception: October 2017

The story starts way back to when Justin and I moved to Toronto to start our life together in October 2017. One of the first things we did was set up a budgeting spreadsheet. It started off simple and innocent just tracking our daily transactions. Eventually, we developed a routine surrounding our shared Google Sheets which amounted to over 20 tabs and dozens of cross-sheet formulas. Our routine and process strengthened while our Google Sheet paired with our lack of expertise in Excel formulas stagnated. As this was happening, the idea of writing an app and having more computational freedom since I could code all my desired formulas started to float around in my head.

## June 2018

In June of 2018, my sister-in-law who just graduated from college visited us in Toronto. She was interested in getting her finances in order and I introduced her to our method and even set her up with her own working copy of our budgeting spreadsheet.

## Finding Purpose: September 2018

At this point, we are about 3 months leading up to our departure date, we both went through a bit of a crisis trying to figure out exactly how we were going to pass the time while we were there. We both wanted to use this time to accelerate something related to our personal productivity or growth. We were not interested in seeing all the sights and doing all the day trips.

On a trip to visit Justins’ family, it was revealed that my sister-in-law was still using the budgeting spreadsheet I previously set her up with, and even wanted to get her boyfriend on it. That ended up being enough validation for me to build out a web app version. I began to seriously explore the idea of working on this while in Japan.

Eventually, we both decided to take a break from our current freelancing contracts for at least a month, starting around Christmas time and ending the first week of February. That way, we would have a nice break to clear our heads and to start our travels without distractions, and to settle into Japan on our own pace. It would surely help us answer the question, what would we do if we had all the time in the world?

## Design Kick-off: November 2018

I started with some initial designs to get creative juices flowing and excitement rising.

## Programming Kick-off: December 2018

I decided to start programming during the Christmas break when we were visiting Justins’ family in Minnesota. I started exploring different frameworks and tried to lock down my stack. Eventually, I decided to use Node.js (familiar), React (familiar) along with Semantic UI (something new) and PostgresQL (familiar).

I knew that all I needed was to get my web app to the point where Justin and I could completely switch off of our spreadsheet.

The very first of many tasks was to re-skin Semantic UI to fit my designs.

### Setting up for a positive and productive routine

After we moved into our apartment and signed up for a gym, we basically had everything we needed to start forming a routine. Within the first week, we were following a rough routine of going to the gym in the morning, cooking lunch afterwards, and heading to the local start up cafe to hammer out roughly 5 hours of work before heading back home to cook or go out to eat dinner.

Justin and I are both the type of people who will happily stay up late working on something that interests us, just to get up early in the morning to pick back where we left off. We both get really into what we’re doing at the moment. When I find something that can make me feel that way, it’s incredibly special to me and brings me back to my summers in grade school just learning the world of web development for the first time.

Our routine quickly materialized around three core components: gym, cooking, and personal projects. We knew we would be eating a lot here so one of the first things we did when we landed was explore our neighbourhood gyms and sign up for a membership.

Another goal of mine for Japan was to learn more and experiment with Japanese cuisine. Supermarkets here have vastly different offerings and we knew that I’d be able to find ingredients for much cheaper here. We really wanted to do a lot of cooking here, so making sure we were eating in as much as we were eating out was important to us.

## February 1, 2019

February was by far the most productive month. We had a full month with very minimal obligations and we had found a free co-working space that we ended up holing ourselves in almost every day for at least 4 hours.

I think it was a blessing that the start-up cafe closed because it forced us to find other options. As a result, we started working out of Starbucks and one other coffee chain wherein it’s not totally frowned upon to stay for a few hours with your laptop. It allowed us to explore more neighbourhoods by anchoring ourselves to a coffee shop for work for a few hours.

### Milestones

On February 1, I got Justin and I up and running on an internal alpha. It was glorious and Justin immediately filed a handful of bugs. Perfect!

I also started freelancing again, committing about 2 hours per day. I scheduled my daily standup for 7:30am, forcing myself to be up by then and start my day. I was able to finish “work” by 9:30am, just in time to go to the gym and make lunch and have an afternoon free to work on Lunch Money.

## March 2019

In March, we met up with Justin’s parents in Tokyo for a little over a week. We also spent some extra days in the city to hang out with some friends. All in all, this ended being a 10 day break away from Lunch Money. I still kept up my freelancing commitments but the rest of the time was spent sightseeing and catching up with friends.

### Milestones

Got someone else onboarded to Lunch Money other than me and Justin!

## April 2019

My parents visited us for a total of 17 days and we were vacationing in Okinawa for 4 days.

# The Good Parts

* Learning typescript
* Getting organized on my own (Harvest, Asana)
* Having full control, setting code quality
* Justin helping with the parts I’m weak at, like setting up my environments and writing my currency fetcher script!

# The hard parts

At the peak of our work, I sometimes questioned how we were spending our time. We were in this new country to discover yet we were spending all our waking time working on our computers. Was that pretty lame? Was it wasting our opportunity here? On the other hand, the freedom to work endlessly on a passion project is something to equally out-of-reach from before and we could be anywhere in the world doing that.

Sometimes, I would lose motivation. Or think about why I’m even doing this in the first place. Who would even use it? Sometimes when you’re a one-person team working on everything from design to coding to marketing and you’re supposed to hold the key to the grand vision all the way down to what to name every individual variable. It becomes a lot and sometimes I have to take a break. In some ways, it helped that I was wearing many hats because when I got burnt out from coding, I could switch to another part of my brain and work on design.

Some breaks I took were longer than others, and made it quite difficult to get back into what I was doing before, especially with the amount of bugs piling up.

Losing motivation

Not having the time to work on it after working on it non stop for a month

Hard to step away

Able to context switch, design when got tired of coding; coded when had design block

# How it's different

4 key differences that are important to me that I can't find all together in the budgeting apps I have tried.

### Multi-currency

Multicurrency is something that lacks in the major budgeting apps, like YNAB and Mint. This is extremely important to us because we have money in both American and Canadian financial institutions and we also travel frequently and like to keep track of our cash spending in local currencies, especially in places where cash is king (Taipei, Japan).  Lunch Money was designed from the beginning with multi-currency in mind.

### Recurring expenses not part of the budget

It never made sense to me why other budgeting apps make you include your recurring expenses in the monthly budget. If you know that every month, you’ll be paying exactly whatever amount for a Netflix subscription, gym membership and car insurance, why carry the mental burden of remembering that for your budget every month?

We recognized this when we were doing our spreadsheet, so I created a Recurring Expenses sheet that kept track of our monthly and annual expenses. I really like this system because it’s able to tell us exactly _how much money we need to simply get through the month_. If we were to not spend a penny, we’d still need at least some amount of money disposable to cover these recurring expenses.

To me, it makes the most sense to separate these out into their own categories.

### Re-budget every month with last month's data, no rolling over because we want to be building good habits, not trying to cover up bad ones

Justin and I’s end-of-the-month routine for the last 1.5 years involved going through our monthly budget, seeing where we went over-budget, and setting the next month’s budget. We did so by looking at what we set last month and how much we were over (or under) that month. We also considered upcoming events that might need some extra budgeting, for instance if we had birthdays coming up and we wanted to budget more for restaurants, or weddings coming up would require extra budgeting in the gifts category. For the first x months, we over budgeted, but eventually we got better at being realistic about our spending.

I don’t believe in rolling over budgets because I believe that we should be building good habits rather than trying to cover up bad ones. It will take a while, but in the end you will strengthen your ability to anticipate varying spending levels.
