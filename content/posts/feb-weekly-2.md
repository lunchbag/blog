Wow, where did the week go?

Luckily I can answer that question since I use the [Daily Time Tracking](http://dailytimetracking.com/) app!

This week, I put in roughly 40 hours of work in the last 7 days. Let's use this time breakdown as a template for this week's retrospective.

### Engineering: 17 hours, 9 minutes

I often get asked how I prioritize features or decide what to work on next. In the beginning, I worked tirelessly at reaching feature parity with other personal financial apps. Now that we're past that, I no longer feel the same urgency as I did in our first year to get out as many features as I can.

Recently I set up a [feature request board](https://feedback.lunchmoney.app) so I (and other users) can see what the top requested features are. While it's very useful for me to know, the most requested features are not necessarily what's next on the docket.

One of the ways I exercise my freedom as a solopreneur is that I generally work on whatever I want. This, for me, keeps things fun, interesting and most importantly, sustainable. Of course, whatever I want usually aligns with what my users want because I want my users to be happy!

If I force myself to keep coding when I don't feel like it, I'd probably lose interest and that would likely be fatal to my SaaS business. I never want to get to a point where I dread working on Lunch Money.

Anyways, back to how I figure out what to work on next. Being a Lunch Money user myself and chatting with users on a daily basis, I have a really good idea of what features can differentiate Lunch Money from the others, and what feature improvements will improve the experience for existing users. These two are always top of mind and guide my own prioritization of feature requests.

Next, I will have a sense of how large of a task I feel like working on– maybe it's been a while since I did a large task (1+ week) and I'm feeling up for it again (they really are draining!). Or maybe I want to knock something out within a day or two. Based on the bandwidth I'm willing to commit for the next task, I scan our Canny to see what feature matches this criteria.

All that being said, the latest new feature for Lunch Money is manual crypto tracking! If users don't want to connect to their wallets or exchanges directly, they can choose from over 300 cryptocurrencies to track manually. We pull in the latest exchange rates every 15 minutes. As far as I know, none of the top personal finance apps out there offer this.

### Support: 6 hours, 28 minutes

I don't love that I am spending so many hours on customer support every week. This is something I need to actively work on reducing more. I've written before about how I [optimize my customer support flows](https://lunchbag.ca/company-of-one) as a company of one but I guess Lunch Money has since levelled up and this is one of those scaling problems that are good to have.

Technically, I could still keep going and spend time on support, but it's getting to the point where it doesn't make sense. I would rather have 6 extra hours a week to code, chill or do whatever else I want.

Issues related to Plaid come up the most frequently, cost me the most time all the while being the most tedious yet straightforward to handle. It usually involves grabbing some debug logs, opening up a support ticket with Plaid and proceeding to play middleman between my user and Plaid for the next few days.

I've started the process of setting up a shared inbox and writing down common support workflows on how to handle Plaid. I've also posted a position for a part-time customer support agent on Upwork and already I'm seeing some very promising candidates! 

It's super important to me that whoever I hire to interact with our users can maintain Lunch Money's brand voice as friendly, helpful and delightful. I'll likely start them off on just Plaid-related issues as I think it's still important for me to interact directly with users when it comes to bug reports. (Side note– since setting up our Canny, I've gotten close to 0 feature requests in my support inbox!)

### Setting up for EU expansion: 3 hours, 50 minutes

After nearly 2 years of being shut out of Plaid's EU offerings, I finally received word that we're officially able to expand to Europe by supporting GDPR-compliant bank syncing for our European users! 

This week, I started a pilot program to have a slow and controlled onboarding of users.

I first reached out to existing users and churned users who specifically noted they wanted EU bank syncing. Finally, I sent out a newsletter to all our subscribers with an open call to join the pilot. Over 60 people have shown interest so far and nearly 50% of those people are not yet paying Lunch Money users.

I'll likely need to do some internal auditing before going public & live with this new integration and familiarize myself more with GDPR. 

### Engineering (General): 6 hours, 10 minutes

"Minor" bug fixes and "minor" feature improvements don't seem so minor anymore when I realize I spent over 6 hours on them. This is mostly from revamping the visual filter for the Accounts page and supporting multiple file uploads for our CSV importing tool (see our latest changelog entry [here](https://feedback.lunchmoney.app/changelog/153)).

### Contractor prep: 3 hours, 33 minutes

To recap from [last week's retrospective](https://lunchbag.ca/feb-weekly-1), I hit a bit of a snag while trying to hire for an apprentice. I realized that I need to hire a marketing assistant who could execute. 

A Lunch Money user reached out to me and proposed that she and a colleague come onboard as a team of two to help me with my marketing needs on a project basis. It was almost exactly what I wanted to hear and we spent some time going back and forth on expectations. Finally, we jumped on a call to meet face-to-face and even ended up finding out that we grew up within the same neighbourhood in the suburbs of Toronto!

I spent time this week writing out a project brief to outline exactly what needs to be done. I'll essentially have her and her colleague rewrite the copy for our [marketing site](https://lunchmoney.app), specifically the feature-specific pages. Deadline should be the end of the month, so we'll see how that goes!

### Preparing email newsletter: 2 hours, 32 minutes

Did it really take me 2 and a half hours to prepare and send out our latest feature newsletter? :facepalm:

### Miscellaneous: 47 minutes

Other random small tasks like replying to emails can really add up!

# What went well

## Lunch Money

* Netlify published [their case study on the engineering behind Lunch Money](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/02/10/the-url-is-the-interface-lunch-money-web-app-scales-on-the-jamstack)! For a long time, I've been wanting to write about our architecture so when I found out that Netlify wanted to write one for their blog to spotlight web apps on the Jamstack, I was ecstatic! I'm still in shock that a huge and successful company like Netlify put the time and effort into writing a case study on my little app!
* Launched two major features this week– manual crypto tracking and bank syncing support for some EU banks! Both of these features help further differentiate Lunch Money from the other personal finance and budgeting apps out there.
* Got unstuck on the hiring front– excited to see how the project-based work goes for rewriting our landing page material and also fantasizing about the extra time I will regain when I hire someone to help with support.

## Personal life

* Having the week "off" for Lunar New Year was great! It felt nice to wake up every day and have a more-or-less free schedule. The streets were very empty and barely any restaurants were open so I ended up cooking a lot too.

# What didn't go so well

## Lunch Money

* I wasn't able to get done any of the onboarding/walkthrough material that I set out to do. I get many 1 or 2 cancellation requests every week with the reason "the product is too difficult to use" and a few requests for tutorials on how to get started so it really sucks to feel like the delightfully "simple" part of our tagline is slowly starting to not ring as true anymore.

## Personal life

* My brand new running shoes broke! Something came loose between the fabric and now juts out and chafes against the back of my foot. The retail landscape and return policies in Taiwan are a bit unfamiliar to me and I was worried that since the purchase was from over 30 days ago, that I would be totally out of luck. I went back to the Nike store and they told me that they could take the shoes and start a return process that would likely take 3 (!!) weeks. So I guess in 3 weeks, I'll either be returned my faulty shoes or be given a credit. The worst part is that since it's Lunar New Year, the return process will take a bit longer _and_ there are virtually no sales anymore so my replacement shoes will cost much more than the original ones I bought on sale.

# Next goals

* Make moves on outsourcing tasks so I can reclaim my time and focus on what I enjoy most– engineering & writing.
* Plan out what effective onboarding tutorials and walkthrough guides would look like.
