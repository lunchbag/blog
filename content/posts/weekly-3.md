This has been a crazy week. I feel like in the last 7 days, Lunch Money, the app, is now Lunch Money, the business that's just beginning.

## Hiring

Even just a month ago, I was pretty dead-set on not hiring anybody. Well, in the last week I've effectively hired 3 people: 1 marketing manager (unofficial name), 1 writer and 1 part-time customer support agent.

The marketing team of 2 is the one who approached me which I mentioned in [last week's retrospective](https://lunchbag.ca/feb-weekly-2). Since sending over the project brief, they've gotten straight to work and I have been super impressed with their deliverables.

I've essentially hired them to rewrite Lunch Money's marketing site, in particular, the feature-specific pages. For reference, the current marketing site was 100% written by me. I didn't have much of a strategy beyond the "common sense" strategy which is "well, this sounds right to me so it should be okay".

Hiring is very humbling. I stand by what I said in an earlier article, [Optimizations as a Company of One](https://lunchbag.ca/company-of-one):

> I equate it to doing a job yourself before hiring someoneâ€“ itâ€™s always better to grok the requirements first to some degree so you can understand how to best utilize who youâ€™ve brought on (and appreciate them more!).

Content marketing and copywriting is not just stringing together words that sound about right. It's beyond an artform. There's a lot of research and analysis and even psychology that goes beyond it and I didn't even realize that some of what I was requesting simply _does not make sense_.

For example, I thought it would be cool to have an entire page that explains why someone should support independent developers. 

**How I thought it would go down:**

Me: Let's have a page that explains why someone should support independent developers.

Writer: Ok!

_A day later_

Writer: Here's the copy!

Me: Great!

ðŸŽ† _5,000 pageviews per day_ âœ¨

**What actually happened:**

Me: Let's have a page that explains why someone should support independent developers.

_A day later_

Marketing Manager: Well, _actually_, while research shows that people love a good founder story, the type of content on this page is not expected to rank higher than any of the existing "build in public"-type articles since search intent is more geared towards long-form content as opposed to a page on a marketing landing site. Instead you should add bullet points on the advantages in your About page and/or pricing page since there's more value as supporting content instead of a standalone page.

Me: Ah.

It's honestly amazing. I hadn't realize how deep the world of content marketing goes. For each of my feature pages, they did very in-depth research into competing pages and strategized what Lunch Money's angle should be to optimize for our Google ranking.

I realized my prior strategy was very much luck-based and no different than throwing darts in the dark. It worked well for me in the beginning but as Lunch Money matures, I now realize how valuable a well-thought-out content marketing strategy is.

With every deliverable I get from the writer, it seems like he's running his content through a variety of tools to measure readability and rankability. 

Needless to say, so far I'm impressed and excited for the final result and how it affects our ranking. It also bodes well that this duo is based in Toronto, so while I'm sleeping, they're working away and when I wake up, I usually have something to give them feedback on. 

## Customer support

I also hired a part-time customer support agent to help out for about 5 hours per week. At the moment, I'm only having them help out with Plaid support tickets. I used Upwork to find someone and I ended up hiring a very lovely lady from the Phillipines and I love that we're in the same timezone since we can go back and forth easier because this role is more hands on.

## Affiliate Program

Early last week, the director of advertising for a mid-tier publication reached out to me and said they were interested in featuring Lunch Money in their "Top crypto portfolios" listicle which gets 45,000+ pageviews per month. 

I've been very hot and cold with going forward with an affiliate program for some time now. The main hesitation is that I had this mystical idea that I could just continue with organic growth and I shouldn't need to pay for pageviews and that if my product was good enough, word of mouth could naturally drive up my signups.

Sounds a bit silly now. I Tweeted earlier this year that one of my resolutions with regards to Lunch Money is to put more money back into the business. I ended up sinking a couple hundred dollars only to come away with low double-digit signups. The cost per trial sign up was not worth it by far.

I consulted with my friend who I admire a lot as a digital marketer who gave me some tips on thinking about affiliate programs.

\- 15% to 20% not per invoice. 1-time upfront commission

\- Don't go into it with a long-term mindset. Let's test this out for 3 months and see what the conversion rate and sign ups are like.

I suggested a 15% commission on the first invoice. This protects me since I only pay if I get a conversion. Some other affiliate programs pay out just for a trial, but there's no guarantee the trialing user will convert. I also specified that this is a non-recurring commission. I was really excited that they were down with the scheme and included Lunch Money in several of their listicles. On top of that, they want to feature me in their Women History Month broadcasting which will include a panel on females in the FinTech space!
