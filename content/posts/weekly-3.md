This has been a crazy week. I've always been shy about calling Lunch Money "a real company" but in the last 7 days, Lunch Money has surely graduated from just being an app to being a full-blown business.

# Hiring

It's funny that just a few weeks ago, I was pretty happy and set on the leisurely path of staying a company of one. By last Wednesday, I had effectively hired 3 people: a marketing manager, a writer and a part-time customer support agent.

The marketing team of 2, originally mentioned in [last week's retrospective](https://lunchbag.ca/feb-weekly-2), have gotten straight to work since I sent over the project brief.

To quickly recap, I hired them on a project-basis to rewrite Lunch Money's marketing site, in particular, the feature-specific pages. For reference, the [current marketing site]() was 100% written by me. I didn't have much of a strategy beyond "well, this sounds right to me so it should be okay".

Hiring is very humbling. I stand by what I said in an earlier article, [Optimizations as a Company of One](https://lunchbag.ca/company-of-one):

> \[..\] doing a job yourself before hiring someoneâ€“ itâ€™s always better to grok the requirements first to some degree so you can understand how to best utilize who youâ€™ve brought on (and appreciate them more!).

For anyone out there who thinks content marketing and copywriting is just stringing together words that sound about rightâ€“ I was right there with you until just a few days ago.  It's the amalgamation of research, analysis and user psychology that goes beyond an artform or a wordsmith's craft.

I hadn't even realized some of what I was requesting was not strategically sound. For example, I thought it would be cool to have an entire page that explains why someone should support independent developers. Why not further solidify my narrative as a bootstrapped founder and show my support for the community, right?

### **How I thought it would go down:**

Me: Let's have a page that explains why someone should support independent developers.

**Marketing Manager:** Ok!

_A day later_

**Writer:** Here's the copy!

**Me:** Great!

ðŸŽ† _5,000 pageviews per day_ âœ¨

### **What actually happened:**

**Me:** Let's have a page that explains why someone should support independent developers.

_A day later_

**Marketing Manager:** Well, _actually_, while research shows that people love a good founder story, the type of content on this page is not expected to rank higher than any of the existing "build in public"-type articles since search intent is more geared towards long-form content as opposed to a page on a marketing landing site. Instead you should add snippets on the advantages in your About page and/or pricing page since there's more value there as supporting content.

**Me:** ðŸ¤¯

I am honestly amazed at the depth of content marketing. For each of my feature pages, they did very thorough research into competing pages and strategized what Lunch Money's angle should be to optimize for our Google ranking.

I realized that my prior content strategy was no different than throwing darts in the dark. It worked well for me in the beginning to simply have a landing page but as Lunch Money matures as a business, I now see the value in a well-thought-out content marketing strategy.

The pieces from the writer so far have been superb and it looks like he's running through a set of tools to measure readability and rankability. Needless to say, so far I'm impressed and excited for the final result and how it affects our ranking.

## Customer support

I also hired a lovely lady from the Phillipines via Upwork to be my part-time customer support agent. At the moment, she's helping me with Plaid support tickets.

I spent a ton of time preparing for thisâ€“ over 10 hours writing a guide in Notion on how to handle Plaid accounts and another 10 hours on an admin portal for gathering debugging information. It was probably more than I would have liked to spend but my attitude is always to do it right the first time because I want the foundation to be strong. Since the customer care team has the potential to expand in the future, I want to invest in tools and wikis that will ultimately save me time in the future.

My hire has been great so far (look out for an email from Ann if you're having issues with your synced accounts!) and I love that we're in the same timezone since this role requires a bit more back-and-forth communication during the training period.

## Affiliate Program

Early last week, the director of advertising for an online FinTech media company reached out and said they were interested in featuring Lunch Money in their "top X crypto portfolios trackers" listicle which gets 45,000+ page views per month.

Of course, they were looking for an affiliate deal. I've been very hot and cold with going forward with an affiliate program for some time now. The main hesitation stems from this fantasy idea that I could continue growing organically and that if my product was good enough, word of mouth would naturally continue to drive up my signups for free.

I could theoretically stop all marketing efforts and still grow at a slow and steady rate, but since I was presented with the opportunity to supercharge growth, I decided to take it. I didn't have a good reason why so much as I didn't have a good reason why _not_. After all, one of my new year's resolutions with regards to Lunch Money is to put more money back into the business.

When I first started contemplating affiliate marketing, I consulted with a friend of mine whom I admire a lot as a digital marketer. He gave me some tips on how to structure the dealâ€“ don't go for recurring commission and don't go into it with a long-term mindset to test the waters.

I suggested a three-month affiliate deal for a 15% commission on the first invoice. This protects me since I only pay if I get a conversion. Some other affiliate programs pay out just for a trial and others pay out a commission on every single invoice.

I was really excited that they accepted the deal and ended up included Lunch Money in several of their listicles (best X budget apps, best X budget apps for couples), etc. On top of that, they want to feature me in their Women History Month broadcasting which will include a panel on females in the FinTech space! Feels good to gain a champion of their calibre and I'm excited to see how many new users this brings in over the next 3 months.

# What went well

## Lunch Money

* Nearly everything. Lunch Money levelled up this week.

## Personal life

* Justin and I celebrated our 3rd wedding anniversary! We had a wonderful dinner where we had deep conversations about all aspects of our life. We're both super busy with our current endeavours and we both have high aspirations. I feel lucky to have a supportive partner.

# What didn't go so well

## Lunch Money

* I didn't end up doing any engineering work at all! My hope with hiring and outsourcing work was so it would free up my time to do more coding & writing. While I'm still finding time to write, preparing for the new hires took quite a bit of time this week.

## Personal life

* I considered getting Lasik surgery and went in for a consultation. Ultimately, I shied away from the idea. I don't think I want or need Lasik bad enough to justify the risks as well as the side effects and post-op procedures and healing.

# Next goals

Get back to engineering! I have a ton of backlogged tasks and bugs to fix.
