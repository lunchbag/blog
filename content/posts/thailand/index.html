    <h1>Scooters</h1>
    <p><i>Ubon Ratchathani</i></p>
    <p>
      The man at the shop did not want to let me leave the store. I suppose it
      was suspicious that I asked him to give me a quick rundown of all the
      controls right after I assured him that I'd ridden one of these things
      before. It was the truth, though. A few days ago at the farm, I asked
      Jessada to teach me how to ride his motorbike and I received a 15 minute
      lesson– much more efficient than the 2-day, 16 hour class I passed up in
      San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hesitant as he was, he realized his wife had already processed the 500
      baht (~ 14USD) I had paid for a full day rental and he was anxious to
      return to his cigarette. He gave me a thorough review and watched
      nervously as I tried to get the 200 lb scooter off their property
      gracefully yet quickly before he could change his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scooter was automatic and much simpler to handle than the
      semi-automatic motorbike I used to learn. Theoretically, it should have
      been easier, except instead of being on a huge farm with idling sheep as
      obstacles to avoid, I was in a populous Thai city that mostly got to
      places on motorized wheels and without much regard for traffic rules. Red
      lights were a mere suggestion. The one with the larger set of balls gets
      the right of way. To develop this intuition would have surely taken me a
      while. I knew I had to get out of the busy city center if I were to
      survive an entire day on this thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ended up riding an hour east along the Mun river to a city called Phibun
      Mangsahan. As someone who's spent most of her life avoiding combinations
      of speed and perceived danger, it was thrilling! There was little to no
      traffic for 90% of the ride. It was my first time feeling such freedom–
      different than having a car and all the windows down. It was hot that day
      (well, it's hot everyday) and I didn't even mind that everytime a truck
      passed by, dust, dirt and occasionally ill-fated bugs would fly into my
      body and stick to my sweat.

    <h1>Being Canadian</h1>
    <span
      >I realized much too late in my trip that Thai people either 1. do not
      think/know about Canada at all, and/or 2. do not understand the concept of
      multi-culturalism. It took me a while to decipher the look people would
      give me after I tell them I am from Canada. My moment of clarify came when
      one of the more adept English-speaking Thais would reply, "Canada? But you
      look so Asian!".</span
    >

    <h1>Camping</h1>
    <p><i>Khong Chiam</i></p>
    <p>
      The whole situation was confusing because we could not understand each
      other. Yet I, and another girl (M), agreed to go on an overnight trip with
      our host (K) with whom we usually speak in bursts of loosely-strung verbs
      and nouns and trust that we're both walking away with the same
      interpretation of the conversation. My understanding was that we would be
      going camping in Khong Chiam, the eastern-most city in Thailand, bordering
      Laos and boasting views of the famous Mekong River. M was fairly convinced
      we would be staying with our host's friend who owns or works at a temple
      in the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      K commissioned a local bus driver and his wife to accompany us to our
      destination (we only found this out much later. M and I spent most of
      dinnertime trying to figure out the relationship of the 2 mystery people
      and our host. They seemed like friends, but the man and woman were doing
      all of the dinner prep work as well as the cooking and cleaning.) The ride
      took about 2 hours and we made a stop along the way at the local market
      before reaching the national park (we had no idea we were heading towards
      a national park. The admission fee for foreigners was about $15US compared
      to about $2US for locals).
    </p>

      <span class="caption"
        >Known as the "2 color river", this is the spot where the Mun river
        (flowing eastwards from Thailand, starting near Pak Chong) and the
        Mekong river (flowing from western China through Southeast Asia,
        dividing Thailand and Laos) meet. During rainy season, it's said you can
        see distinctly the two colors of the river when they join.</span

        >Pha Tam National Park boasts the first sunrise in Thailand. We got up
        at 5:30AM to witness this. It was beautiful and then quickly turned
        blinding and I spent the rest of the morning questioning the
        significance of waking up early to watch the sunrise seconds before the
        rest of Thailand (who would surely still be asleep) could.</span

      >
    </div>

    <p>
      To M's dismay, my deduction skills triumphed and we ended up camping
      inside Pha Tam National Park. It was the most unprepared I had been for a
      camping trip since I tried to pack light, somehow thinking we would be
      going on a hike and I didn't want to lug around a lot of stuff with me.
      The camping experience wasn't too different than what I've experienced in
      America. It was nice because we were able to rent tents and sleeping bags
      for a low price (about $6 total) and they even set it up for us. The
      restroom facilities were also very clean!
    </p>

    <h1>Crop burning</h1>
    <p><i>Wung Si Sote</i></p>
    <p>
      I had learned about crop burning before heading over to Thailand since my
      trip was going to overlap with the season. From my understanding, farmers
      burn their crops as a quick means of clearing the land, generating
      fertilizer, and readying for the upcoming rainy season.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my first night at the farm, I was on kitchen duty. I went outside to
      take out some trash when I saw in a not-too-far distance a raging fire! I
      couldn't see much else beyond the trees but there was definitely a huge
      fire growing alarmingly close by. I went inside and asked the other folks
      about it. "Oh yeah, that's normal", Zeke, the youngest boy in the host
      family told us. "You wanna see it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zeke led me and some other volunteers through their family property,
      leaping over giant boulders to get to the barbed wire fence dividing the
      two properties. "What? You've never jumped over barbed wire before?".
      Suddenly I felt like I was on the school playground and the 8th grader was
      sizing me up.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all got over the barbed wire fence, admittedly in a less cool fashion
      and much more age and fragility-aware method than Zeke did, and we were
      right up there with the crop burning. The fire was big yet controlled,
      each sectioned off in a little ditch carefully dug out to prevent any
      unplanned spread.
    </p>

      <source src="/img/cropburning.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>

    <p>
      Zeke shared some interesting insights with me about what would happen if
      the crop burning so closeby were to affect his family's land and damaged
      their property. He told me that in the Thai countryside, usually disputes
      will be settled quickly and fairly. The party who was in the wrong (and
      who knows they were in the wrong) would not try to hide their guilt and
      instead negotiate down a settlement to the injured. This is because it's a
      hassle for everyone to head into the city to go to court. The courts in
      Thailand are often overbooked and the trip in during business hours would
      cost farmers valuable time they could be spending prepping their land.
      Thus, fairness and quickness to settlement is an understood and shared
      value in the countryside.
    </p>

    <h1>Night markets</h1>
    <p>
      I don't have much to share about the various night markets I visited in
      Thailand, but here's a cool video I shot of a night market setting up in
      Pak Chong.

    <h1>Phana</h1>
    <p>
      Phana is a small village of 2000 people in the province of Amnat Charoen.
      It has garnered small town fame for the
      <a href="https://thaimonkeyforest.com" target="_blank"
        >Don Chao Poo Monkey Forest</a
      >, though it still remains largely unknown to oversea and even local
      tourists. The village sees a small but steady stream of foreigners that
      come to the village to either teach English at the local school or
      researchers that come to conduct studies on the monkeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was told that I was the first official tourist whose purpose was solely
      to explore and learn the culture of Phana. By comparison, my stay would be
      much shorter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had 2 sets of hosts in Phana– the first was the owner of the home I
      stayed in and the second is a retired couple. The wife, Pensri, is Thai
      and grew up in Phana, and her husband, Lawrence, is British. While in
      Phana, I had the opportunity to:
    </p>
    <div class="image">
      <img src="/img/monkeys.jpg" />
      <span class="caption"
        >... visit the monkey forest. We fed them leftover vegetables and
        fruits. Locals usually come by to leave food for the monkeys, and of
        course monkeys love food so they will swarm the generous donor to get
        their share and then run off to a safe distance away to enjoy their
        fare. Pictured is Lawrence spreading the fare of oranges.</span

    <div class="image">
      <img src="/img/highschool.jpg" />
      <span class="caption"
        >.. visit the local high school open house. They had performances by
        students and every school subject had a booth showcasing projects from
        the year. Many local education officials attended the open house and we
        were asked to stand in many pictures with them, I suspect, because we
        are foreigners. My impression was that having foreigners in a picture
        helps boosts the prestige. <br /><br />Side note: I felt like a
        celebrity in Phana. Even though I am also Asian, I looked very different
        from your average Thai person. I was asked to take many selfies and be
        in many photos with locals, including a swarm of 10 police officers at
        the local night market!</span

        Now, he's retired back near Phana where he serves a single dish, duck
        noodle soup, out of his home.</span

        Buddhist monks only eat 2 meals a day and both are eaten before noon.
        Since they don't have any money, they make their rounds through the
        village in the morning gathering food from the locals.</span

    <p>
      It was a great experience. If you'd like to visit Phana, the best way to
      do so is through
      <a
        href="https://www.i-likelocal.com/activities/thailand/homestay/have-a-local-experience-in-northeast-thailand/"
        target="_blank"
        >a homestay</a
      >. The village does not have any hotels nor do they actively promote
      tourism.

    <h1>Thai showers</h1>
    <p><i>Phana</i></p>
    <p>
      In Phana, I stayed in a traditional wooden-style house built by the father
      of my host. The house itself is beautiful with mostly handmade wooden
      furniture. I had my own bedroom upstairs and there was an out of place
      high-tech washing machine on the first floor for us to use. So far so
      good, until she showed me the bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bathroom itself was large, but bare. In one corner was a western-style
      toilet, and in another, a large and blocky basin full of water. It was the
      size of a bathtub but with taller dimensions and it was built into the
      walls of the bathroom (like what a tub in a Lego house might look like if
      you and I had the same architectural imagination as a kid). There was also
      no sink; in fact, the faucet could be seen hanging from a hole in the
      wall. I asked about it, and my host told me sheepishly that the sink is
      broken. You could tell she had no intention or use in fixing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time I took a Thai shower, I was very hesitant. The water had
      been sitting there for god knows how long and there could have been
      hundreds of dead mosquitos or bacteria floating around. But it was my only
      choice. So I picked up the giant floating scoop, filled it with water,
      took a deep breath, and dumped the cold liquid over my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      In just a split second, I understood why the Thai shower exists. It is so
      hot in Thailand and this basin of water stays at a perfect cool
      temperature throughout the day. There is no need for a water heater so
      really there is no need for a western-style shower. It is dry in Thailand
      and water is scarce, so having it come out of a shower head can simply be
      wasteful. And yes, the number of dead mosquitos floating around gradually
      increases but it's negligible when you think about the amount of bugs
      flying into you and getting caught in your sweat throughout the day.
      Lastly, having water dumped on you versus a stream coming out of a
      showerhead are two completely different showering experiences, the former
      now being my preferred method.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became a huge fan of the Thai shower. I didn't mind getting hot and
      sweaty during the day because I looked forward to showering the second the
      sun set every night. It was the most glorious reward for getting through
      another hot day in Thailand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phana was the only place I experienced this. While I was staying at the
      farm, they actually upgraded our standing showers to have the large
      rainwater showerheads. That, too, was glorious. I'm convinced showers are
      just great all around. <span></span>
