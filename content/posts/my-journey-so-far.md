+++
This is a recounting of my journey so far. My journey is my own and was always under my own control. I'm not sure if it's fair to say that it's a digital nomad's journey, or an entrepreneur's. Every part of my travel was a different phase of my life. It is an ongoing journey and I hope it never ends :)

## 2012

### **May**

I graduated from a Canadian university with a degree in computer engineering and my first job was as a software engineer at Twitter in San Francisco.

## 2016

### September

I stayed at Twitter for almost 4 years, experiencing its startup days and well into post-IPO grown-up phase. I ended up leaving because I grew frustrated with the increasing layers of middle management and bureaucracy. 

I ended up co-founding a start-up with my then-roommate and (now still) good friend. We worked on it together for a year, went through the first ever batch of YCombinator Fellowship and eventually made it into 500 Startups. 

I made the decision to leave the startup shortly after we started 500 Startups, mainly because I was burning out. At this point I am 26 years old and had evaluated that I didn't want to spend the rest of my 20s living in a tech bubble and working on a startup. I wanted to go out and explore the world and meet people who were on different journeys in life.

### November

After nearly 5 years of living in San Francisco, I made the difficult yet firm decision to move back home to Toronto. I gave away or sold almost all my stuff and said my goodbyes with no regrets. San Francisco had treated me well, but I was getting too comfortable for my own good.

## 2017

### January

I set off in mid-January to meet my boyfriend at the time in Taipei. He had already been there for 2 months studying Chinese at NTU. I didn't have much of a plan of what I was going to do there so I ended up self-studying Mandarin Chinese as well.

### February

I went to Thailand... without my laptop! Shocking. I started in Bangkok and backpacked my way through the Eastern part of Thailand. I stayed at a farm where I helped herd sheep at sunrise, went through a medical emergency, was the first tourist in a small Thai village known for its monkey forest, and went Thai-style camping near the border of Laos.

### May

Summer was descending upon Asia, which is the last place I want to be at that time due to the humidity and discomfort. I set off to Europe on a working holiday visa. I spent most of my time in France where I was practice my French through experiences like living with a family in the middle of the mountains and working as a bartender/waitress at a restaurant in rural Burgundy. I stayed for weeks in both Paris and Lyon and fell in love with both cities.

Later on, I traveled through Italy, Estonia, Finland (went to a music festival there), Sweden, Denmark, the U.K., and finally back to France where my parents met me for a 2-week vacation before heading back home.

### September

I had a blast of a summer yet never felt more ready to go back to Toronto. 

### October

My boyfriend at the time joined me in Toronto and we moved in together in a great neighbourhood located in Downtown, Toronto.

### December

We got engaged while on a 3 week trip to Mexico. We started in Mexico City, then moved on to Oaxaca where we took the bumpiest car ride of our lives to San Jose del Pacifico. We stayed in a cozy cabin overlooking a beautiful cliff of trees where my now husband proposed to me. Next, we went to Puerto Escondido, to date still one of my favorite vacation spots.

## 2018

### February

We got married in an intimate ceremony in the house I grew up in with both of our parents as witnesses.

### April

 - Released first app to App Store

### June

I started freelancing for two different companies. This really helped accelerate and improve my knowledge of React.

## 2019

### January

My husband and I set off to Fukuoka, Japan for the next 4 months! Our first time escaping the Canadian winter. It was still quite cold, but never got below freezing and we only saw snow once (and it melted as soon as it hit the ground.

During our time in Fukuoka, I started working on my own app while freelancing for 2 companies in parallel. 

### May

Back to Toronto!

### August

Launched lunchmoney.app, went full-time
