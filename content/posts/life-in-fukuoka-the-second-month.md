title = "Life in Fukuoka: The Second Month"

+++
We're into the second month now and officially halfway through our stint in Japan. It's been interesting to look back and reflect on how our perception of Fukuoka and Japan in general has changed since first arriving starry-eyed. Unsurprisingly, living and (attempting to) integrating into Japanese society is far different than visiting for a short number of weeks. For someone like me who finds immense joy in noticing and analyzing all the details, it's been a real hoot.

While we have been enjoying our time here and conjuring up scenarios in the future where we find ourselves back in Japan, it has also made us appreciate our other home in Toronto, Canada.

Out of the 10 safest countries in the world according to the [World Population Review](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/safest-countries-in-the-world/), at 126 million people, Japan is the highest populated and the highest population density by at least a factor of 3. But it is beyond just lack of violence, crime, and guns which we can all sense after spending just a few days here. Common courtesy and the hyper-awareness of when one might be inconveniencing a fellow citizen are instilled deeply in the Japanese. On top of that, the Japanese hospitality, _Omotenashi_, in which one attempts to anticipate someone else's needs before it's shown or even realized by the person himself, embellishes an already trustworthy society. And we feel it to the point where we might avoid asking a staff member for help because the amount of effort they will pour into finding the solution for us might not be worth the period of awkward broken communication. Shopping at a mall is also a massively different experience in which sales associates are actually trying to actively sell you stuff. The overtly patronization in excessive compliments and oversharing of information bout the piece you were just thinking about 

You can hear a pin drop on the subway or _shinkansens._

If you leave something at a restaurant, the restaurant worker will run after you with the object. There is no concept of leaving it at the front desk and waiting to see if someone will call to claim it. We've witnessed a few times and had our waiter chase after us twice after accidentally leaving Airpods and sunglasses at two different restaurants!

It is not uncommon to see very young children walking the streets or taking the subway by themselves.
