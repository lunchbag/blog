+++
Everyone is a bootstrapped solopreneur until you find a co-founder or raise funding. It's a matter of who stays bootstrapped and solo

3 things to consider to figure out in what capacity staying bootstrapped or staying solo appeals to you

1\. **What you value about being an entrepreneur**

Would you rather be the mom-and-pop shop owner who greets everyone and knows all the regulars and makes the decisions of the interior design and display, etc), or do you want to be the CEO of a big box store that serves millions of people daily and tackles huge problems at scale from the headquarters?

It's the difference between running a lifestyle business and getting a company to unicorn status 

the Journey where the end goal is a company worth $2 to 4M as a solo founder versus $1B with a team of people is so different  and really comes down to what appeals to you about being an entrepreneur

\*Someone who values ownership and autonomy, working at your own pace*

\*Someone who is excited to learn all the different parts rather than excited about hiring (for me, I was always an individual contributor and never a manager)*

\*Someone who enjoys the idea of staying scrappy and moving fast, doing the nitty gritty (Twitter was fun until they went public and all these extra processes got put into place)*

\*Someone who would rather talk to customers than direct reports*

\*Someone who doesn't value climbing the corporate ladder or prestige in that sense*

2\. **Your desired lifestyle and timeline to get there**

one way to think about it

\**because you're only working for yourself, you only need to hit 5-10k MRR** to replace your salary, quit your job and start crafting and living the type of lifestyle you want. you still have responsibilities to your business but you have full autonomy

\- lifestyle-wise, it could be anything from digital nomads who travel and live abroad for months at a time, all the way to parents who want to find ways to spend more time with their families

venture-backed start up is closer to a non-stop grind to an exit thats an average of 7 years away and you could have a team of people depending on you

\**high risk/ high reward - low risk/low reward**

not to say one is more or less ambitious, it comes down to how you want to spend your time and your philosophy on life and work

3\. **The type of business you want to run** (the most practical answer)

This works best for non capital heavy business ideas, like SaaS (and anyone can learn how to code or use no-code.) Quick iterations, easy to vet ideas or pre-sell products, easy to automate things so its much more feasible to be a solo founder. Recurring subscriptions is the best business model for sustainability because that's basically your salary
